# Uber-Data-Analysis-in-R
Goal of this project is to practice visualisations in R. This project is based on understanding the customers who avail the trips using Visualisation with ggplot library in R.

##Uber Data Analysis in R through visualisations

With the help of the visualisations, you can understand the complex data and develop insights. This is a Data Visualisation project which focuses on the Storytelling aspect of the complex data. 

After importing the data, and formatting it into a readable manner, we visualise to create stories. 

We use the ggplot function to plot the number of trips that the passengers  made in a day. We can understand how the number of passengers fares throughout the day. We observe that the number of trips are higher in the evening around 5:00 and 6:00 PM.

Next, we look at the trips by hours of every month.

We look at the number of trips that were made on the very day of the week, every month. We notice an increasing trend of the trips over these months.
