##Uber Data Analysis in R through visualisations

With the help of the visualisations, you can understand the complex data and develop insights. This is a Data Visualisation project which focuses on the Storytelling aspect of the complex data. 

After importing the data, and formatting it into a readable manner, we visualise to create stories.
